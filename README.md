â€¼Forewordâ€¼

  I'm not a cool Engineer Network Developer or Unity Developer. This code is taken from the channel: [**Tom Weiland**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-mDKzV5MW_BXjSDRqqHUw)
  And I believe that this will be my starting point for learning the network.
  In the future, I will supplement all this with new knowledge and chips. ðŸ˜Š
